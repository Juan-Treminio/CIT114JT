# Notes 03 – AWS Global Infrastructure
### AWS Infrastructure Features
First, AWS Infrastructure is elastic and scalable. This means resources can dynamically adjust to increases or decreases in capacity requirements. It can also rapidly adjust to accommodate growth.
Second, this infrastructure is fault tolerant, which means it has built-in component redundancy which enables it to continue operations despite a failed component.
Finally, it requires minimal to no human intervention, while providing high availability with minimal down time.
### AWS Foundational Services
Compute: services help you make the most of your data. They support research and big data processing. AWS compute services cover virtual machines, containers, serverless computing, and more.

Storage: AWS storage solutions provide reliable, scalable, and secure storage for backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity.

Databases: are built for different data models and use cases and offer speed, reliability, availability, and security.

Networking: AWS networking and content delivery are designed to ensure that AWS has the networking capabilities required to run any workload in the cloud with security, availability, performance, global coverage, and manageability.
## Quotes:
“As of June 2020, Amazon Web Services had 25 different categories of cloud-based services with 1 or more products in each service category.” I found this quote interesting because of how big and how many options there are for an individual or business.

“AWS has the largest global infrastructure footprint of any cloud provider in order to deliver customer’s content through a worldwide network of Points of Presence (PoP) locations.” I found this quote interesting because it states of what kind of a juggernaut AWS is compared to other providers.
## New Facts:
AWS Wavelength: embeds AWS compute and storage services within 5G networks, providing mobile edge computing infrastructure for developing, deploying, and scaling ultra-low-latency applications.

AWS Outposts: is a family of fully managed solutions delivering AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a truly consistent hybrid experience. Outposts solutions allow you to extend and run native AWS services on premises, and is available in a variety of form factors, from 1U and 2U Outposts servers to 42U Outposts racks, and multiple rack deployments.

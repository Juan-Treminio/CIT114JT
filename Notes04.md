# Notes 04-AWS Cloud Security 

Hacker, attacker, or intruder – These terms are applied to the people who seek to exploit weaknesses in software and computer systems for their own gain.  

Malicious code – Malicious code (also called malware) is unwanted files or programs that can cause harm to a computer or compromise data stored on a computer. Malicious code may have the following characteristics: 

1) It might require you to do something before it infects your computer.  

2) Some forms of malware propagate without user intervention and typically start by exploiting a software vulnerability.  

3) Some malware claims to be one thing, while in fact doing something different behind the scenes.  

Vulnerabilities – are flaws in software, firmware, or hardware that can be exploited by an attacker to perform unauthorized actions in a system. 

### Basic cybersecurity best practices: 

1) Keep software up to date. Install software patches so that attackers cannot take advantage of known problems or vulnerabilities. 

2) Run up-to-date antivirus software. A reputable antivirus software application is an important protective measure against known malicious threats. It can automatically detect, quarantine, and remove various types of malware.  

3) Use strong passwords. Select passwords that will be difficult for attackers to guess, and use different passwords for different programs and devices.  

4) Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). Authentication is a process used to validate a user’s identity. Attackers commonly exploit weak authentication processes. 

5) Install a firewall. Firewalls may be able to prevent some types of attack vectors by blocking malicious traffic before it can enter a computer system, and by restricting unnecessary outbound communications. 

6) Be suspicious of unexpected emails. Phishing emails are currently one of the most prevalent risks to the average user.  

## Quotes: 

“AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources for your users.” I found this quote interesting because it sounds exactly like Azure and Active Directory where you put people in groups to give them access to certain services. 

“Securing the cloud is about more than just using Identity and Access Management. Cloud providers have many tools at their disposal to secure accounts.” I found this quote interesting because they do have a lot of ways to secure information, but some people are still hesitant to be part of the cloud. 

## New Facts: 

Five DevSecOps Organizational Characteristics: 

1) A customer-focused mindset that tailors security programs and outcomes to customer needs and business outcomes. 

2) Scalability—security needs to evolve to keep pace with business outcomes through the introduction of parallel working style and conditions for security teams. 

3) Objective criteria that allows business executives to know how, when and in what order to improve the security profile of its business resources. 

4) Proactive hunting through the introduction of Red Teams that scopes out an organization’s technology environment to prioritize remediation efforts. 

5) Continuous detection and response that provides monitoring and analysis of external attempts to attack company targets and allows for incidents to be defeated quickly.

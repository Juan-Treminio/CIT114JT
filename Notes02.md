# Notes 02 – Cloud Economics and Billing
### Pay-as-you-go
With AWS you only pay for what use, helping your organization remain agile, responsive and always able to meet scale demands.
### Pay less by using more
With AWS, you can get volume based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services such as S3 and data transfer OUT from EC2, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB.
### There are three fundamental drivers of cost with AWS:
•	Compute

•	Storage

•	Outbound data transfer

### AWS offers several pricing models depending on the product. These include:
•	On Demand: means you pay for compute or database capacity with no long-term commitments or upfront payments.

•	Dedicated Instances: run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that’s dedicated to a single customer.

•	Spot Instances: are an Amazon EC2 pricing mechanism that lets you purchase spare computing capacity with no upfront commitment at discounted hourly rates.

•	Reservations: provide you with the ability to receive a greater discount, up to 75 percent, by paying for capacity ahead of time
## Quotes:
“Amazon Web Services (AWS) helps you move faster, reduce IT costs, and attain global scale through a broad set of global compute, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services.” I found this quote interesting because AWS is getting richer by providing these services but at the same time reducing costs for the businesses.

“Managing cost-effectively from the start ensures that managing cloud investments doesn’t become an obstruction as you grow and scale.” I found this quote interesting because it does make sense as a business owner to understand and manage your money well.




## New Facts:
### Types of IT infrastructure:
Traditional infrastructure

With a traditional infrastructure, the components—like datacenters, data storage, and other equipment—are all managed and owned by the business within their own facilities. Traditional infrastructure is often thought of as expensive to run and requires large amounts of hardware, like servers, as well as power and physical space.

Cloud infrastructure

Cloud infrastructure describes the components and resources needed for cloud computing. You can create a private cloud by building it yourself using resources dedicated solely to you. Or you can use a public cloud by renting cloud infrastructure from a cloud provider like Alibaba, Amazon, Google, IBM, or Microsoft. And by incorporating some degree of workload portability, orchestration, and management across multiple clouds you can create a hybrid cloud.

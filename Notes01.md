# Notes 01: Cloud concept overview

CIT 114-Juan Treminio

## Business Drivers:
1)	Capacity Planning - the process of determining and fulfilling future demands of an organization's IT resources, products, and services.
2)	Cost Reduction – no need for investment to be funneled into infrastructure expansion.
3)	Organizational Agility - the measure of an organization's responsiveness to change.

## Risk and Challenges:
1)	Increased Security Vulnerabilities - The moving of business data to the cloud means that the responsibility over data security becomes shared with the cloud provider.
2)	Reduced Operational Governance Control - Cloud consumers are usually allotted a level of governance control that is lower than that over on-premises IT resources.
3)	Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers - It can be challenging to move from one cloud provider to another.
4)	Multi-Regional Regulatory and Legal Issues 

“Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider.” I found this reference interesting because so many applications and software that I use are part of SaaS. The more I learn about IT, the more I recognize things that everyone uses in their everyday life without knowing how it operates behind doors.
“Cloud computing provides developers and IT departments with the ability to focus on what matters most and avoid undifferentiated work such as procurement, maintenance, and capacity planning.” I found this sentence interesting because there are so many ways for a business or an individual to use technology in a way that would just make a certain job or task easier.

## Facts that I learned from this module are the services:
•	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

	It is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet.

	Quickly scale up and down with demand and pay only for what you use.

•	Platform as a Service (PaaS)

	is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, with resources that enable you to deliver everything from simple cloud-based apps to sophisticated, cloud-enabled enterprise applications. 

	You purchase the resources you need from a cloud service provider on a pay-as-you-go basis and access them over a secure Internet connection.


•	Software as a Service (SaaS)

	allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. 

	Common examples are email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).
